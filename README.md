This repository is a culmination of a few of my work doing data analysis in R.
Each folder is organised by some general theme as labelled.
You will most likely be interested in the PDF or Rmd files, however I provided the CSV files for the corresponding analysis along with them.
On the off chance anyone wants to replicate or improve upon my work... god forbid. :D
